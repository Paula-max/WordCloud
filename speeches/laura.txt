Thank you to the Academy for this honor. Just to be in this room with such
remarkable artists, including my fellow nominees, my sisters and colleagues.
Thank you, Netflix, my friend Ted, Scott, everyone for their support and
love. To Noah, his vision, his magic. Thank you, Noah, for your words, and
for your friendship in art and life, with you and Greta. Thank you to this
cast, the majestic Adam, Scarlett, Alan, Ray, our amazing crew, David. Noah
wrote a movie about love and about breaching divisions in the name and in
the honor of family and home, and hopefully for all of us, in the name of our
planet. And I would like to say a special thank you to the gifts of the love
stories in my life: my stepchildren, C.J. and Harris, my heart and inspiration,
Ellery and Jaya. And you know, some say never meet your heroes, but I say, if
youâ€™re really blessed, you get them as your parents. I share this with my
acting heroes, my legends, Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern. You got game. I love
you. Thank you all for this gift; this is the best birthday present ever.
I love you. I love my friends. You lift me up every day. Thank you.
