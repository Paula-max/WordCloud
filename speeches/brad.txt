Wow. Thank you, this is incredible, really incredible. Thank you to the
Academy for this honor of honors. They told me I only have 45 seconds up
here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week.
I’m thinking maybe Quentin does a movie about it, in the end the adults
do the right thing. This [holds up Oscar statuette] really is about
Quentin Jerome Tarantino. You are original, you are one of a kind. The
film industry would be a much drier place without you and I love the ethos
you gave Cliff Booth. Look for the best in people, expect the worst but
look for the best. Leo, I’ll ride on your coattails any day, man. The
view’s fantastic. And to the rest of the cast and crew: big bad Bob
Richardson, Robert Garcia, Richie, my man Mike Moh. You know, I also want
to say, you know, while we’re doing all this, it’s time we give a little
love to our stunt coordinators and our stunt crews. Listen, I’m a bit
gobsmacked. I’m not one to look back but this has made me do so and I think
of my folks taking me to the drive-in to see BUTCH AND SUNDANCE, and
loading up my car and moving out here, and Gina and Ridley giving me my
first shot to all the wonderful people I’ve met along way, to stand here
now: “Once upon a time…in Hollywood.” Ain’t that the truth. This is for
my kids, who color everything I do. I adore you. Thank you.
